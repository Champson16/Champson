            <td><p>Our mission is to help children to gain a better understanding of nutrition to realize greater concentration, energy and well being, ultimately in the long-term, better health. Our goal is to make applications and products that inspire and interest young people. We hope that with engagement we can help to foster a generation of self-determined, knowledgeable and motivated young people who can make the best possible choices for themselves.</p>
              <p>We know that people of all ages engage and retain information when there is discovery and interaction. We have developed characters and story lines to connect nutritional education with activities and games. Our central goal is to empower children to make their own healthier choices for a better life. </p>
